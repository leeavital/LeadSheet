Guido of Arezzo (also Guido Aretinus, Guido da Arezzo, Guido Monaco, or Guido 
d'Arezzo) (991/992 â€“ after 1033) was a music theorist of the Medieval era. He 
is regarded as the inventor of modern musical notation (staff notation) that 
replaced neumatic notation; his text, the Micrologus, was the 
second-most-widely distributed treatise on music in the Middle Ages (after the 
writings of Boethius).
